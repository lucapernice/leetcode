# Count Nice Pairs In An Array

This Python project contains a function `count_nice_pairs_in_an_array` that calculates the number of "nice" pairs in a given list of non-negative integers. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is considered "nice" if `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`, where `rev(x)` is a function that returns the reverse of the non-negative integer `x`.

## Function Explanation

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. The function `rev(x)` is defined to reverse a given non-negative integer `x`. This is done by converting `x` to a string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer.

2. The function `count_nice_pairs_in_an_array(nums)` takes a list of non-negative integers `nums` as input.

3. It initializes an empty dictionary `differences` to store the frequency of each difference between a number and its reverse in `nums`.

4. The function then iterates over each number in `nums`, calculates the difference between the number and its reverse, and updates the frequency of this difference in `differences`.

5. After that, the function initializes a variable `nice_pairs` to store the total number of "nice" pairs.

6. It then iterates over each unique difference in `differences`, calculates the number of "nice" pairs for this difference (which is the number of ways to pick 2 numbers from the frequency of this difference), and adds this to `nice_pairs`.

7. Finally, the function returns the total number of "nice" pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.

This function uses a dictionary to efficiently count the frequency of each difference, and then calculates the number of "nice" pairs based on these frequencies. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, and the space complexity is also O(n), due to the use of the `differences` dictionary.
