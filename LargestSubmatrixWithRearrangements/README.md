# Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements

This Python script solves the problem of finding the largest submatrix with all ones in a given binary matrix, where the columns of the matrix can be rearranged in any order.

## Problem Description

You are given a binary matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order. The goal is to find the area of the largest sub-matrix within the matrix where every element of the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.

## Functions

The script includes the following functions:

- `consecutive_ones_row(matrix, i, j)`: Returns the number of consecutive ones in a row starting from the [i][j] element.

- `consecutive_ones_col(matrix, i, j)`: Returns the number of consecutive ones in a column starting from the [i][j] element.

- `eval_matrix(matrix)`: Evaluates the area of the largest sub-matrix with all ones in the given matrix.

- `matrix_column_permutation(matrix, permutation)`: Returns the matrix with the columns permuted according to the permutation list.

- `all_permutations(n)`: Returns all possible permutations of the list [0:n].

- `all_matrix_permutations(matrix)`: Returns all possible matrices with permuted columns.

- `largest_submatrix(matrix)`: Returns the area of the largest sub-matrix with all ones.

## Usage

To use this script, import the functions into your Python environment or script. Then, call the `largest_submatrix` function with your binary matrix as the argument. The function will return the area of the largest sub-matrix with all ones.

## Example

```python
matrix = [[1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
print(largest_submatrix(matrix))  # Output: 3
```

## Considerations

Calculating all permutations of the columns in the matrix can be computationally expensive, especially for large matrices. The number of permutations of n items is n! (n factorial), which grows very rapidly with n. For example, there are over 3.6 million permutations of just 10 items.

One possible optimization is to avoid generating all permutations. Instead, you could sort the columns based on the number of ones they contain. This would ensure that columns with more ones are placed first, which could potentially lead to larger submatrices with all ones. Sorting the columns would have a time complexity of O(n log n), which is much more efficient than generating all permutations.

Another optimization could be using a heuristic or greedy algorithm to rearrange the columns. For example, you could start with a random arrangement of the columns, then iteratively swap pairs of columns if the swap increases the size of the largest submatrix with all ones. This would not guarantee finding the optimal solution, but it could find a good solution much more quickly than generating all permutations.

Finally, you could consider using parallel processing or distributed computing techniques to generate the permutations and evaluate the matrices in parallel. This could significantly speed up the computation for large matrices. However, it would also add complexity to the implementation and require additional computational resources.
